Folder creation works, but i still get strange errors and i don't know how to fix or should I ignore them.
Download.php gets info but doesn't download files any more :p, but at least I've got and almost implemented an idea how to
download files and save folder structure.
index2.php is simple structure of html tags, created to use dropzone.js. Upload.php - php script for downloading, but it
doesn't work too :p
upload_test.php - just file for test.
So, every function works exept folder downloading and upload through dropzone.js :(
